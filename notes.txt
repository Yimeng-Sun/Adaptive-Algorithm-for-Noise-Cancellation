1. Filters the input vector x(n) through the adaptive filter
coefficients vector (n 1) to produce the filter output
victory y(n) .
2. Filter y(n) through the secondary path filter s to produce the
secondary actuator response at the sensor ys(n) .
3. Evaluates the current error sampling e(n) d (n) ys(n) .note
the error, here, it is formed by adding the signal rather than
subtracting them to be compatible with real world sensors
such as microphones and accelerometers.
4. Filters the mirrored error vector e(n) through the estimate of
the secondary path se to produce the filter-error signal fe(n) .
5. Uses x(n) and fe(n) to calculate the normalized gradient
vector and uses this to update the adaptive filter
coefficients (n) .
6. Supports both real and complex signals.

=====================================================================\

The output of the adaptive filter is calculated.
y(n) x(n)w(n) (3.38)
2. An error signal is calculated as the addition of desired signal
and the secondary filter output.
. ( ) ( ) n e y s n d n (3.39)
3. The filter tap weights are updated in preparation for the next
iteration is given below
w(n 1) w(n) . fe(n).x(n) (3.40)

=====================================================================\
Why IIR filter is not preferred?

•	Use of Feedback
•	Are sometimes called Recursive filters.
•	Can oscillate if not properly designed.

=====================================================================\
?	Factor that influenced the selection of processor is the Word-Length.
?	FIR filters are preferred over IIR filters due to its Linear Phase Characteristics.
?	Digital filters act in cascaded mode by convolving their coefficients.

An algorithm is proposed to diminish the number of delays and adders.
