24 tap fiter is adopted, to achieve area/power efficient design

64 is not used because larger filter length doesn't always give best noise reduction
it requires higher computational complexity
Tap length is inversly proportional to maximum sampling frequency

A parallel architecture wih more hardware MAC units can obtain higher throughput,we use 3 stage pipeline MAC architecture

Buffer-stores previous values along with current sample
stores M coefficient location datas

1 update circular buffer- low level activty,power consuption 

output of FIR filter appears in every M+4 cycle,delayed to ensure latency on signal matches with latency through MAC engine.
DELAY= no. of pipeline stage+1
=4
finishes all calculations at 2M 

2 counters,for coefficient buffer and input buffer
A comparator(M-2)to disable count per cycle and writes new data into data buffer every M cycle

Proposed 24tap filter divided into 2 parts:
1.Genarating Anti-noise(read-only)
2.Adjust coefficients of adaptive filter(read and write)
